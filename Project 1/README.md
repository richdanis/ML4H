We submit our code for each part of the project in two separate jupyter notebooks: "Part 1.ipynb" and "Part 2.ipynb". 
In the file "requirements.txt" we wrote down all necessary packages in order to be able to execute our code.
For Part 1, we could execute everything locally on our machines. But for Part 2, we uploaded the folder "chest_xray"
to google drive, so that we could access the data in Google Collab.
